# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems. I'll be using this space to organize and share my solutions for problems from the Competitive Programming Bootcamp introduced by the Competitive Programming Team of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, as well as problems from Codeforces generic problem sets and Codeforces solved problems.

## About Competitive Programming

Competitive programming is a sport of solving well-defined algorithmic and mathematical problems within a specified time limit. Codeforces is a popular online platform for competitive programming that hosts a wide range of problems, contests, and challenges. This repository is dedicated to my solutions for Codeforces problems, with an emphasis on the Competitive Programming Bootcamp problems from the Polytechnic University of Valencia.

## Codeforces Problem Categories

This repository will be organized into folders corresponding to different Codeforces problem categories, including but not limited to:
- **Competitive Programming Bootcamp**: Solutions for problems introduced by the Competitive Programming Team of the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
- **Generic Problem Sets**: Solutions for generic Codeforces problem sets that cover a wide range of topics.
- **Solved Problems**: Solutions for Codeforces problems I have solved in the past.
